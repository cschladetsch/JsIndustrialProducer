Just released an open-source Industrial MIDI Song Creator - a web-based tool that generates complex industrial/techno compositions with drag-and-drop song structure building.

Key features:
- Visual song arrangement with 8 section types
- Complex time signatures (7/8, 5/4, 9/8) inspired by Tool and Nine Inch Nails
- Real-time Web Audio synthesis with adjustable distortion
- Generates standard MIDI files for DAW import
- Seed-based randomization for unique variations

Built with vanilla JavaScript and Web Audio API. No dependencies, runs entirely in the browser.

Perfect for producers looking to quickly prototype industrial track ideas or experiment with unconventional song structures.
