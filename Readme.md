# INDUSTRIELL KLANGMASCHINE - Industrial MIDI Song Creator

**Note:** For the full experience with parameter controls, song generation, and real-time playback, please download and run locally. 

## üé∏ NOW WITH MODULAR ARCHITECTURE! üé∏

The application has been refactored from a monolithic 2600+ line file into a clean modular structure using ES6 modules. Choose your version:

- **`./r`** - Launch the modern modular version with clean architecture
- **`./r-original`** - Launch the classic monolithic version (2600+ lines of raw power)

Both versions are fully functional with identical features.

## Overview

JsIndustrialProducer is a web-based application that generates industrial/techno MIDI songs with customizable parameters. This tool allows musicians and producers to quickly create industrial-style MIDI compositions that can be imported into digital audio workstations (DAWs) for further production. While designed for industrial music, the application can produce surprisingly calming ambient soundscapes at slower tempos (60-80 BPM), offering versatility beyond its industrial roots.

## Parameters

### Tempo (BPM)
- **Range**: 60-140 BPM
- **Default**: 70 BPM
- **Description**: Controls the speed of the song. Lower values (60-80 BPM) create slower, more atmospheric and surprisingly calming ambient tracks, while higher values create more energetic industrial compositions. Despite the industrial theme, slower tempos can produce meditative soundscapes.

### Intensity
- **Range**: 1-10
- **Default**: 7
- **Description**: Affects the velocity of MIDI notes and the volume/filtering of the preview. Higher intensity creates more aggressive, louder sounds.

### Distortion
- **Range**: 0-100
- **Default**: 60
- **Description**: Applies waveshaping distortion to the bass sounds during preview. Higher values create more industrial, gritty textures.

## Playing MIDI Files

### Option 1: Web Browser (Built-in)
The application includes full Web Audio synthesis. Just click "Play Full Song" after generating.

### Option 2: VLC Media Player
VLC requires a soundfont to play MIDI files:
```bash
# Install FluidSynth and soundfont
sudo apt install fluidsynth fluid-soundfont-gm

# Then open the MIDI file in VLC
vlc industrial_song.mid
```

### Option 3: TiMidity++ (Recommended for Linux)
```bash
# Install TiMidity++
sudo apt install timidity timidity-interfaces-extra

# Play the MIDI file
timidity industrial_song.mid
```

### Option 4: Digital Audio Workstation (Best Quality)
Import the MIDI into a DAW for professional results:

**Free DAWs:**
- **LMMS**: `sudo apt install lmms`
- **Ardour**: `sudo apt install ardour`
- **Tracktion Waveform**: Free version available

**Commercial DAWs:**
- Ableton Live
- FL Studio
- Logic Pro (Mac)
- Reaper (60-day trial)

## Browser Compatibility

The application requires a modern web browser with support for:
- Web Audio API
- Blob API
- ES6 JavaScript features

Tested and confirmed working on:
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Troubleshooting

### No Sound During Playback
1. Check your system volume
2. Ensure your browser allows audio playback (click elsewhere on the page first)
3. Try a different browser

### MIDI File Won't Play in Media Player
- Install a soundfont (see "Playing MIDI Files" section above)
- Use a dedicated MIDI player or DAW
- Try the built-in web playback instead

### Browser Issues
- Clear browser cache
- Disable ad blockers for local files
- Make sure JavaScript is enabled

## Musical Theory

### Scale and Harmony
The generator uses minor pentatonic scales and power chord progressions typical of industrial music:
- Root notes centered around E (82.41 Hz)
- Harmonics at perfect fifths and octaves
- Chromatic passing tones in bridge sections

### Rhythm Patterns
- **Verse**: Steady eighth-note patterns with syncopated accents
- **Chorus**: More aggressive sixteenth-note patterns
- **Bridge**: Slower, atmospheric whole notes
- **Intro/Outro**: Sparse patterns for tension building/release

## Testing

The project now includes comprehensive unit tests for all core functionality:

```bash
# Run tests
node test-industrial-midi.js
```

Test coverage includes:
- **Utility Functions**: Random number generation, MIDI encoding, frequency conversion
- **Pattern Generation**: Pitch variation, pattern generation, bass/lead patterns for all sections
- **MIDI File Creation**: Header generation, track creation, complete file assembly
- **Lyrics Generation**: Line generation, vocabulary usage, section-specific lyrics
- **Edge Cases**: Extreme values, empty inputs, boundary conditions

   - Try a simpler song structure

## Technical Notes

The application generates MIDI data in real-time using bitwise operations to create proper MIDI byte sequences. The Web Audio API implementation uses oscillators, filters, and gain nodes to approximate the sound of classic industrial synthesizers. The distortion algorithm uses a waveshaping technique that emulates analog distortion circuits.
