## Overview

JsTechnoProducer is a web-based application that generates industrial/techno MIDI songs with customizable parameters. This tool allows musicians and producers to quickly create industrial-style MIDI compositions that can be imported into digital audio workstations (DAWs) for further production.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Real-time MIDI Generation**: Create complete MIDI songs with multiple tracks instantly
- **Full Song Playback**: Listen to the entire song directly in the browser using Web Audio API
- **Drag & Drop Song Builder**: Visually arrange song sections with intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- **Customizable Song Structure**: Choose presets or build completely custom arrangements
- **Parameter Control**: Adjust tempo, intensity, distortion, and song length
- **Multi-track Output**: Generates bass and lead tracks with complex time signatures
- **Randomization**: Each generated song is unique with seed-based variations

### User Interface
- **Dark Industrial Theme**: Visually appealing dark interface matching the industrial music aesthetic
- **Real-time Visual Feedback**: See the song structure and playback progress
- **Responsive Controls**: Sliders and dropdowns for intuitive parameter adjustment
- **Section Visualization**: Color-coded display of song sections (intro, verse, chorus, bridge, outro)
- **FFT Frequency Analyzer**: Real-time spectrum visualization with multiple display modes

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **Pure JavaScript**: No external dependencies or frameworks required
- **Web Audio API**: For real-time audio synthesis and playback
- **MIDI File Format**: Generates standard MIDI files compatible with all major DAWs
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Modern web standards for the interface
- **Canvas API**: For real-time frequency spectrum visualization
- **AnalyserNode**: Web Audio API's FFT analysis for frequency data

### MIDI Implementation
The application generates Type 1 MIDI files with:
- **Track 1**: Tempo and time signature information
- **Track 2**: Bass/rhythm track using Synth Bass 1 (Program 38)
- **Track 3**: Lead/melody track using Synth Lead (Program 80)

### Song Structure Options
1. **Standard**: Intro → Verse → Chorus → Verse → Chorus → Bridge → Chorus → Outro
2. **Simple**: Verse → Chorus → Verse → Chorus
3. **Extended**: Extended version with double choruses for longer compositions
4. **Industrial**: Atmospheric with extended intro/outro sections

### Audio Synthesis
The full song playback uses Web Audio API to create:
- **Sawtooth waves** for bass sounds with adjustable distortion
- **Square waves** for lead sounds with low-pass filtering
- **Dynamic gain control** based on intensity settings
- **Section-specific frequency patterns** for musical variation
- **Complete song structure** with all sections played in sequence
- **Real-time FFT analysis** with 2048-point resolution

### Frequency Analyzer
The built-in spectrum analyzer provides:
- **Three Visualization Modes**:
  - **Bars**: Color-coded frequency spectrum (purple to red gradient)
  - **Waveform**: Time-domain oscilloscope view
  - **Circle**: Radial frequency visualization
- **Song Progress Tracking**: Visual indicator shows current playback position
- **Section Information**: Displays current section name and position (e.g., "VERSE (3/18)")
- **Time Display**: Shows elapsed and total time
- **Frequency Range**: 20Hz to 20kHz with labeled markers
- **Responsive Design**: Auto-scales to window size with proper DPI handling

## Parameters

### Tempo (BPM)
- **Range**: 60-140 BPM
- **Default**: 85 BPM
- **Description**: Controls the speed of the song. Lower values create slower, more atmospheric tracks while higher values create more energetic compositions.

### Intensity
- **Range**: 1-10
- **Default**: 7
- **Description**: Affects the velocity of MIDI notes and the volume/filtering of the preview. Higher intensity creates more aggressive, louder sounds.

### Distortion
- **Range**: 0-100
- **Default**: 60
- **Description**: Applies waveshaping distortion to the bass sounds during preview. Higher values create more industrial, gritty textures.

# Install FluidSynth and soundfont
sudo apt install fluidsynth fluid-soundfont-gm

# Then open the MIDI file in VLC
vlc industrial_song.mid
```

### Option 3: TiMidity++ (Recommended for Linux)
```bash
# Install TiMidity++
sudo apt install timidity timidity-interfaces-extra

# Play the MIDI file
timidity industrial_song.mid
```

### Option 4: Digital Audio Workstation (Best Quality)
Import the MIDI into a DAW for professional results:

**Free DAWs:**
- **LMMS**: `sudo apt install lmms`
- **Ardour**: `sudo apt install ardour`
- **Tracktion Waveform**: Free version available

**Commercial DAWs:**

## Troubleshooting

### No Sound During Playback
1. Check your system volume
2. Ensure your browser allows audio playback (click elsewhere on the page first)
3. Try a different browser

### MIDI File Won't Play in Media Player
- Install a soundfont (see "Playing MIDI Files" section above)
- Use a dedicated MIDI player or DAW
- Try the built-in web playback instead

### Browser Issues
- Clear browser cache
- Disable ad blockers for local files

## Musical Theory

### Scale and Harmony
The generator uses minor pentatonic scales and power chord progressions typical of industrial music:
- Root notes centered around E (82.41 Hz)
- Harmonics at perfect fifths and octaves
- Chromatic passing tones in bridge sections

### Rhythm Patterns
- **Verse**: Steady eighth-note patterns with syncopated accents
- **Chorus**: More aggressive sixteenth-note patterns
- **Bridge**: Slower, atmospheric whole notes
- **Intro/Outro**: Sparse patterns for tension building/release

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Sound During Preview**
   - Ensure your browser allows audio playback
   - Check system volume settings
   - Try clicking elsewhere on the page first (some browsers require user interaction)

2. **MIDI File Won't Download**
   - Check browser download settings
   - Ensure pop-up blockers aren't preventing the download
   - Try a different browser if issues persist

3. **Playback Stuttering**
   - Close other browser tabs to free up resources
   - Lower the intensity parameter
   - Try a simpler song structure

## Technical Notes

The application generates MIDI data in real-time using bitwise operations to create proper MIDI byte sequences. The Web Audio API implementation uses oscillators, filters, and gain nodes to approximate the sound of classic industrial synthesizers. The distortion algorithm uses a waveshaping technique that emulates analog distortion circuits.
